# CARL

**Coding Agent Runtime Layer** — macOS edition.

CARL is a single-machine bootstrap and update tool. It produces a reproducible developer environment on Apple Silicon Macs for running AI coding agents (Codex CLI and Claude Code) alongside a normal terminal/Node/VS Code workflow. Everything is pinned in version-controlled files in this repo; the same script handles initial setup and subsequent updates.

## What it does

Running `./bootstrap.sh` from a checkout of this repo will, idempotently:

1. Verify you're on macOS arm64.
2. Load and validate version pins from `<domain>/env` files (no `latest` allowed).
3. Prompt for Git identity (skipped on re-runs if already configured).
4. Install Xcode Command Line Tools, Homebrew, and the embedded Brewfile.
5. Install canonical configs into `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.nvmrc`, and `~/.config/carl/zsh/core.zsh`.
6. Wire `~/.zshrc` to source `core.zsh` (idempotent, marker-bounded).
7. Set `zsh` as the default shell.
8. Install pinned npm globals: Codex CLI, Playwright, `@playwright/mcp`.
9. Install Claude Code via the native installer and link it onto PATH.
10. Install `br` and `bv` (beads) from GitHub releases, with a `bd → br` shim.
11. Install Playwright browsers (default: Chromium).
12. Verify everything is on PATH and write `~/.bootstrap_done` with a versions snapshot.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd CARL
./bootstrap.sh
```

That's it. After it finishes, open a new terminal (or `hash -r`) so the new PATH takes effect.

## Updating

Edit a version in the relevant `<domain>/env` file, commit it, then on the target Mac:

```bash
git pull
./bootstrap.sh
```

The script detects already-satisfied installs and only does the work needed for whatever changed.

Every tool/service has its own directory containing a non-secret `env` file (with version pins or settings) and any canonical config files copied verbatim into `~/` during bootstrap. See [docs/config-architecture.md](docs/config-architecture.md).

## Adding or updating a tool

See [docs/adding-a-service.md](docs/adding-a-service.md).

## Version pinning

Every version in a domain `env` file must be an exact pin. The script rejects `latest` and (for everything except `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`) `stable`. `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=stable` is allowed because that's the keyword the Claude Code installer itself accepts.

## Marker file

`~/.bootstrap_done` records the script version, source git ref, Brewfile hash, and every pinned version installed. Useful for inspecting "what did this machine actually get."
